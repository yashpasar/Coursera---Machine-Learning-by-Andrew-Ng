# Coursera---Machine-Learning-by-Andrew-Ng
This is a popular course for Data Science on Couursera. It covers all the concepts from scratch for one to begin it's journey in Data Science. 
This repository contains all the materials for one to refer and get back on track in case he/she has enrolled for this fantastic course.
All the assignments were implemented on MATLAB. Will try to implement the same in Python in future.
